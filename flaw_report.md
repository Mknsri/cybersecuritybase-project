This report outlines the found 5 vulnerabilities and how to replicate them, and ultimately how to fix them.

Vulnerability nr 1: Forcing user log out using a CSRF -vulnerability
Description: A logged in user that visits the login page (found at http://<host>/login) logs the user out. This is an intended feature since the logout button on the main page directs to this page. This however opens up a vulnerability where if the user is tricked to request this page when logged in the app, the user is logged out.
